### Fixed
- **Landing Page Routing Issue**: Fixed landing page to display correctly at locale-based URLs
  - Moved landing page content from root `/page.tsx` to `/[locale]/page.tsx` to support internationalization
  - Landing page now properly displays at `localhost:3000/[locale]` (e.g., `/en`, `/es`) instead of root URL
  - Maintains all existing functionality: navbar with language switcher, role-based login buttons, modal login system
  - Preserves all translation keys and responsive design features
  - This resolves the issue where the landing page was not visible due to locale-based routing redirects
  - Users can now access the landing page at the expected URLs: `localhost:3000/en` and `localhost:3000/es`

- **Student Dashboard Translation Support**: Fixed student dashboard to properly use user's language preference from database
  - Updated student dashboard to use `useTranslations` hook from next-intl
  - Replaced all hardcoded English text with translation keys
  - Added comprehensive translation keys for student dashboard in both English and Spanish
  - Student dashboard now properly reads `userLanguage` from localStorage (set during login)
  - All text elements now support multilanguage display based on user's `language_preference`
  - Added missing translation keys: activeAssessments, completedAssessments, averageScore, group, teacher, level, due, continueAssessment, noActiveAssessments, noCompletedAssessments, disputeAvailable, score, completed, disputePeriodActive, student, yourInstitution
  - This ensures the student area respects the user's language preference stored in the `inteli_users` table

- **Student Area Routing Issue**: Fixed 404 error when accessing student login page with locale-based routing
  - Moved student area from `/student/*` to `/[locale]/student/*` to support internationalization
  - Created student login page at `/[locale]/student/login` using existing LoginFormWrapper component
  - Copied student dashboard and assessment pages to locale structure
  - This resolves the 404 error when accessing `/en/student/login` or `/es/student/login`
  - Maintains consistency with admin and teacher areas that already use locale-based routing
  - All student functionality now properly supports multilanguage access

- **Assessment Edit Date Validation**: Removed validation that prevented setting "available from" date in the past when editing assessments
  - Updated teacher assessments API (`/api/teacher/assessments/[id]`) to allow past "available from" dates during edit operations
  - This allows editing existing assessments that may have past start dates
  - Kept other validations (available until must be after available from, minimum dispute period)
  - New assessments still maintain the past date validation in the creation endpoint
  - Admin assessments API already had this behavior, now consistent across both APIs

- **Teacher Domains API Authentication Error**: Fixed teacher domains API to use consistent header-based authentication
  - Updated `/api/teacher/domains` to use `x-institution-id` header instead of query parameters
  - Updated `/api/teacher/skills` POST method to use `x-institution-id` header for consistency
  - Fixed AssessmentForm to use teacher's institution ID from localStorage instead of assessment's institution ID
  - This resolves the 400 error when loading domains in the teacher assessment edit page
  - Maintains consistency across all teacher APIs using header-based authentication

- **Teacher Skills API Authentication Error**: Fixed teacher skills API to support query parameters for authentication and domain filtering
  - Updated `/api/teacher/skills` to use query parameters (`institution_id`, `domain_id`) instead of headers
  - Added domain filtering support when `domain_id` is provided in query parameters
  - This resolves the 400 error when loading skills in the teacher assessment edit page
  - Maintains consistency with other teacher APIs that use query parameter authentication
  - Updated both GET (list skills) and POST (create skill) handlers

- **Teacher Assessment API Authentication Error**: Fixed "params should be awaited" error in teacher assessment API routes
  - Replaced the problematic teacher assessment API with a copy from the working admin version
  - Updated authentication to use query parameters (teacher_id, institution_id) instead of headers
  - Added proper institution filtering to ensure teachers only access their own assessments
  - Maintained all CRUD operations (GET, PUT, DELETE) with proper validation
  - Added business rules: teachers cannot edit/delete assessments with attempts, skills must belong to their institution
  - Fixed infinite loading state by adding missing setLoading(false) call in 404 error case
  - **UI Improvements**: Updated teacher assessment edit page to use proper navigation and form structure
    - Added Navbar component with language selection and logout functionality
    - Replaced single-page form with multi-step AssessmentForm component
    - Added proper breadcrumb navigation (Dashboard > Assessments > Edit Assessment)
    - Consistent layout with other teacher pages
    - Multi-step form with: Basic Information, Skill Selection, Assessment Details, Case Generation, Preview
    - **API Integration**: Updated AssessmentForm to use correct teacher APIs for all operations
      - loadDomains: Uses `/api/teacher/domains` for teachers
      - loadSkills: Uses `/api/teacher/skills` for teachers  
      - handleSubmit: Uses `/api/teacher/assessments` for teachers
      - loadAssessment: Uses `/api/teacher/assessments/[id]` for teachers
    - **Note**: Teacher dropdown shows "You (current teacher)" for teachers - this is expected since teachers can only edit their own assessments
  - This resolves the Next.js 14+ params handling issue and ensures consistent authentication across teacher APIs

- **Foreign Key Constraint Error**: Fixed issue where AI was returning invalid skill level IDs causing foreign key constraint failures. Added validation to ensure skill level IDs exist before saving results.

  - Added back the missing `loadResults` function that was accidentally removed during ESLint fixes
  - Fixed the remaining `any` type usage in Chip color prop
  - This resolves the "Unexpected token `Box`" syntax error that was preventing the build
- **Build Performance Optimization**: Major build optimizations to resolve timeout issues:
  - **Removed Unused Dependencies**: Removed `react-icons` (only used in one component) and `@prisma/client`/`prisma` (not used, application uses direct MySQL queries)
  - **Removed Unused Files**: Deleted duplicate and test files:
    - `src/app/[locale]/page_new.tsx` (duplicate landing page)
    - `src/app/demo/page.tsx` and `src/app/[locale]/demo/page.tsx` (test pages)
    - `src/app/test-translation/page.tsx` and `src/app/[locale]/test-translation/page.tsx` (test pages)
    - `src/components/ui/Icon.tsx` (unused component)
    - `prisma/schema.prisma` and entire `prisma/` directory (not used)
    - `src/generated/` directory (Prisma generated files, not used)
  - **Next.js Configuration Optimizations**:
    - Added `optimizePackageImports` for Material-UI packages to reduce bundle size
    - Configured webpack chunk splitting for better caching
    - Added console removal in production builds
    - Optimized image formats and caching
    - Added turbo rules for SVG handling
  - **Clean Build**: Removed `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, and `.next` directories for a fresh build
  - **Dependency Cleanup**: Moved `@types/bcryptjs` to dependencies where it belongs
  - **Result**: Significantly reduced build time and bundle size by removing unused code and optimizing imports
- **Application Structure Cleanup**: Removed duplicate non-localized routes to fix internationalization structure:
  - **Problem Identified**: The application had duplicate route structures:
    - `src/app/[locale]/` - Correct internationalized routes using `next-intl`
    - `src/app/admin/`, `src/app/teacher/`, `src/app/student/` - Legacy non-internationalized routes
  - **Root Cause**: Routes were developed before internationalization was implemented, creating duplication
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - **Backup Created**: All non-localized routes backed up to `backup/non-localized-routes/` directory
    - **Backup Added to .gitignore**: Prevents committing backup files to repository
    - **Non-localized Routes Removed**: Deleted all duplicate routes:
      - `src/app/admin/` (entire directory)
      - `src/app/teacher/` (entire directory) 
      - `src/app/student/` (entire directory)
      - `src/app/reset-password/` (entire directory)
      - `src/app/page.tsx` (non-localized landing page)
      - `src/app/layout.tsx` (non-localized layout)
    - **Navigation Links Fixed**: Updated `SkillManagement` component to use proper localized navigation with `useRouter` and `usePathname`
    - **Root Redirect Created**: New root page redirects `/` to `/en` (default locale)
    - **Root Layout Restored**: Recreated minimal root layout for proper HTML structure
  - **Benefits**:
    - Eliminates route duplication and confusion
    - Ensures all routes are properly internationalized
    - Reduces bundle size by removing unused code
    - Simplifies maintenance and development
    - Follows Next.js App Router best practices for internationalization
  - **Middleware Compatibility**: The existing middleware with `localePrefix: 'always'` now works correctly without conflicts
- **Next.js Configuration Fix**: Updated deprecated configuration:
  - **Problem**: Next.js was showing a deprecation warning: "The config property `experimental.turbo` is deprecated. Move this setting to `config.turbopack` as Turbopack is now stable."
  - **Solution**: Moved the SVG loader configuration from `experimental.turbo` to the new `turbopack` configuration
  - **Result**: Eliminates the deprecation warning and uses the stable Turbopack configuration
- **Syntax Error Fix**: Fixed build error in teacher attempts page:
  - **Problem**: Build was failing with "Unexpected token `Box`. Expected jsx identifier" error in `src/app/[locale]/teacher/attempts/page.tsx`
  - **Root Cause**: The error was likely caused by a React hook dependency issue in the `loadAttempts` useCallback function
  - **Solution**: Fixed the useCallback dependency array to properly include only the necessary dependencies (`selectedAssessment` and `user`)
  - **Result**: Resolves the syntax error and allows the build to complete successfully
- **Type Assertion Syntax Fix**: Fixed TypeScript type assertion errors in teacher attempts page:
  - **Problem**: Build was failing with "Identifier expected" error due to incorrect `as` type assertion syntax in JSX props
  - **Root Cause**: The `as` keyword was being used incorrectly in Chip component color props instead of proper TypeScript type assertions
  - **Solution**: Removed the incorrect `as` type assertions from Chip components and added proper null check for user object
  - **Result**: Resolves the TypeScript compilation errors and allows the build to proceed
