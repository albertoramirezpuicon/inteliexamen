## Technical Implementation

### Student Attempt Page Updates
```typescript
// Updated ConversationMessage interface
interface ConversationMessage {
  id: number;
  message_type: 'student' | 'ai';
  message_text: string;
  message_subtype?: 'regular' | 'clarification_question' | 'clarification_response';
  created_at: string;
}

// Enhanced turn display with free clarification indicator
<Box sx={{ display: 'flex', gap: 1, alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Chip label={`${getRemainingTurns()}/${getMaxTurns()} turns`} />
  <Tooltip title="Clarification questions and responses don't count toward your turn limit">
    <Chip icon={<HelpIcon />} label="Free clarifications" color="success" />
  </Tooltip>
</Box>

// Clarification message indicators
{message.message_subtype === 'clarification_question' && (
  <Box sx={{ mb: 1, display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 0.5 }}>
    <InfoIcon sx={{ fontSize: 16, color: 'warning.main' }} />
    <Typography variant="caption" color="warning.main" sx={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
      Clarification Question (Free Turn)
    </Typography>
  </Box>
)}
```

### Teacher Skills Page Updates
```typescript
// Updated Skill interface
interface Skill {
  id: number;
  institution_id: number;
  domain_id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  institution_name: string;
  domain_name: string;
  assessments_count: number;
  skill_levels_count: number;
  sources_count?: number;
}

// Sources count column in table
<TableCell>{t('skills.sources')}</TableCell>
<TableCell>
  <Chip 
    label={skill.sources_count || 0} 
    size="small"
    color={skill.sources_count && skill.sources_count > 0 ? "info" : "default"}
    title={skill.sources_count && skill.sources_count > 0 ? `${skill.sources_count} sources configured` : 'No sources configured'}
  />
</TableCell>
```

### API Updates
```sql
-- Updated teacher skills API to include sources count
SELECT 
  s.id, 
  s.institution_id, 
  s.domain_id, 
  s.name, 
  s.description, 
  i.name as institution_name, 
  d.name as domain_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT as2.assessment_id) as assessments_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sl.id) as skill_levels_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT iss.source_id) as sources_count
FROM inteli_skills s
LEFT JOIN inteli_institutions i ON s.institution_id = i.id
LEFT JOIN inteli_domains d ON s.domain_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN inteli_assessments_skills as2 ON s.id = as2.skill_id
LEFT JOIN inteli_skills_levels sl ON s.id = sl.skill_id
LEFT JOIN inteli_skills_sources iss ON s.id = iss.skill_id
WHERE s.institution_id = ?
GROUP BY s.id, s.institution_id, s.domain_id, s.name, s.description, i.name, d.name
```

## Translation Updates

### English (en.json)
```json
{
  "teacher": {
    "skills": {
      "sources": "Sources"
    }
  }
}
```

### Spanish (es.json)
```json
{
  "teacher": {
    "skills": {
      "sources": "Fuentes"
    }
  }
}
```

## Visual Enhancements

### Color Scheme
- **Regular AI Messages**: Secondary color (blue)
- **Clarification Questions**: Warning color (orange) with question mark icon
